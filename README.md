# My Portfolio Blog

This is my personal portfolio blog built with Nuxt.js, Tailwind CSS, and Nuxt Content.

## Technologies Used

- **Nuxt.js**: A progressive Vue.js framework for building server-side rendered and/or static web applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- **Nuxt Content**: A Git-based Headless CMS that allows you to write in a content/ directory and fetch your Markdown, JSON, YAML, XML and CSV files through a MongoDB like API.
- **Vercel**: A platform for static sites and Serverless Functions that fits perfectly with your workflow. It enables developers to host websites and web services that deploy instantly, scale automatically, and requires no supervision, all with minimal configuration.

## Features

- **Devtools Enabled**: This allows for easier debugging during development.
- **Page Transitions**: Smooth 'out-in' page transitions have been implemented for a better user experience.
- **Color Mode**: The site supports light and dark color modes, with different syntax highlighting themes for each mode.
- **Prerendering**: The `/sitemap.xml` route is prerendered for better SEO.
